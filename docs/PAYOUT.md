# Payout

End-to-end bank/UPI disbursal built on the Phase 0 foundation (ledger holds,
field encryption, idempotency, rate limiting, queue worker, partner factory).

Rails: bank transfers (IMPS/NEFT/RTGS) settle through the **Same Day
Settlement** API; UPI payouts ride **RazorpayX** when configured. The app never
calls a rail adapter directly — it resolves `getPartner("payout")`.

## 1. Charge model — service charge is ON TOP

The beneficiary receives the **full** payout `amount`. The user pays:

```
serviceCharge = flat fee by mode/slab        (see src/lib/payout/charges.ts)
gst           = percentOf(serviceCharge, 18) (money.ts, rounded at money scale)
totalDebit    = amount + serviceCharge + gst
```

All math uses `Prisma.Decimal` via `src/lib/money.ts` (`add`, `percentOf`,
`round`). Never `Number()` for money. `quotePayout(amount, mode)` is the single
source of truth, used by the quote endpoint, the submit route, and the UI
preview — the client value is never trusted.

Default service-charge slabs (tune in `charges.ts`):

| Mode | Band (₹)        | Charge |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| IMPS | ≤1,000          | ₹5     |
| IMPS | ≤25,000         | ₹10    |
| IMPS | >25,000         | ₹15    |
| UPI  | ≤1,000          | ₹3     |
| UPI  | ≤25,000         | ₹6     |
| UPI  | >25,000         | ₹10    |
| NEFT | ≤10,000         | ₹5     |
| NEFT | >10,000         | ₹10    |
| RTGS | any             | ₹20    |

## 2. Ledger model (authorization-hold)

- **Submit** → `holdFunds(totalDebit)` reserves funds (no `WalletTxn`).
  `spendable = walletBalance − heldBalance`.
- **Terminal success** → `captureHold(totalDebit, reason PAYOUT)` posts the real
  DEBIT and reduces the hold.
- **Failure / rejection** → `releaseHold(totalDebit)` returns funds to spendable.
- **Post-settlement reversal** → `creditWallet(totalDebit, reason REVERSAL)`.

Idempotency keys: `payout:<id>:capture` and `payout:<id>:reversal` on
`WalletTxn`. Releases are guarded by single-winner conditional status claims.

## 3. State machine

```
PENDING_APPROVAL ──approve──▶ APPROVED ──worker──▶ PROCESSING
       │                                                │
       └──reject──▶ REJECTED (releaseHold)              ├─ success ─▶ SUCCESS (captureHold)
                                                        ├─ failure ─▶ FAILED  (releaseHold)
                                                        └─ (later) ─▶ REVERSED (creditWallet)
```

Every terminal transition uses a conditional `updateMany` claim so exactly one
caller (worker or poller) finalizes. All paths are idempotent and retry-safe.

## 4. Flow

1. **Submit (maker)** — `POST /api/payout`
   - `requireAuth` → `enforceRateLimit(RATE_LIMITS.payoutCreate)` → zod validate.
   - `withIdempotency` on the `Idempotency-Key` header (scope `payout.create`).
   - `quotePayout` computes charge + GST.
   - In one transaction: `holdFunds(totalDebit)` + create `PayoutRequest`
     `PENDING_APPROVAL`. Account/IFSC encrypted (`encryptField`), `accountLast4`
     stored plain for display. Raw PII is never logged.
   - Audit `payout.submitted`.
2. **Approve / Reject (checker)** — `PATCH /api/payout/:id`
   - `assertCanAccessUser(ownerId)` (parent/admin), **maker ≠ checker**.
   - Approve → claim `PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED`, enqueue
     `QUEUES.PAYOUT_INITIATE`, audit `payout.approved`.
   - Reject → claim `→ REJECTED` + `releaseHold`, audit `payout.rejected`.
3. **Worker (PM2)** — `scripts/worker.ts`, queue `payout.initiate`
   - Claim `APPROVED → PROCESSING`, call the payout rail with
     `reference_id = providerReferenceId`, persist response + `providerTxnId`.
   - Terminal success → `finalizePayoutSuccess` (capture + UTR); terminal
     failure → `finalizePayoutFailure` (release). PROCESSING is left for the
     poller. Retry-safe: if already sent, it reconciles instead.
4. **Poller** — scheduled `payout.reconcile` (cron `*/5 * * * *`)
   - Sweeps `PROCESSING` rows older than 120s, polls the rail, finalizes. This
     is the sole finalizer for in-flight payouts (no inbound webhook).

## 5. Providers

- Adapters implement `PayoutProvider`; business code only ever calls
  `getPartner("payout")` — never an adapter directly.
- Routing (`src/lib/partners/index.ts`, gated by `flags.payout` /
  `PARTNER_PAYOUT_ENABLED`):
  - Bank modes (IMPS/NEFT/RTGS) → **Same Day Settlement**
    (`src/lib/partners/sameday-payout.ts`), penny-drop-verified accounts.
  - UPI → **RazorpayX** (`src/lib/partners/razorpay.ts`) when configured.
  - Otherwise → MOCK.
- Unique `reference_id` per payout (`providerReferenceId`, prefix `PO…`) =
  idempotency + reconciliation key.

### Env (`.env` / hosting secrets)

```
PARTNER_PAYOUT_ENABLED="true"
# Bank rail (Same Day Settlement; falls back to the POS key pair when unset)
SAMEDAY_SETTLEMENT_API_KEY="..."
SAMEDAY_SETTLEMENT_API_SECRET="..."
# UPI rail (RazorpayX) — optional
RAZORPAYX_ACCOUNT_NUMBER="..."
RAZORPAYX_KEY_ID="..."
RAZORPAYX_KEY_SECRET="..."
APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="..."   # required for PII encryption (Phase 0)
```

## 6. ⚠️ EC2 static Elastic IP (rail IP-whitelisting)

The Same Day API only accepts calls from **pre-registered source IPs**. The
worker makes the outbound payout calls, so the EC2 instance must egress from a
**static Elastic IP**:

1. Allocate an Elastic IP and associate it with the EC2 instance (or the NAT
   Gateway if the instance is in a private subnet — whitelist the NAT's EIP).
2. Register that EIP with the provider (IP allowlist).
3. Keep the EIP stable across redeploys (it stays associated through PM2
   restarts; only detach intentionally).

Outbound payout calls run **only** from the worker process, so the whitelisted
IP is the box (or NAT) the `shahworks-worker` PM2 app runs on.

## 7. Run / deploy

```powershell
# Local worker (loads .env via Node's built-in loader)
npm run worker

# Apply the migration (ask before running against a shared DB)
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

PM2 (EC2): `ecosystem.config.js` defines two apps — `shahworks` (web,
cluster) and `shahworks-worker` (fork, single instance: pg-boss handles
concurrency and a single scheduler avoids duplicate cron fan-out).

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 logs shahworks-worker
```

## 8. UI

- **`/dashboard/payout`** (maker): spendable/wallet/held cards, beneficiary form
  (IMPS/NEFT/RTGS/UPI), live charge+GST+total preview, submit, and a list of
  the user's payouts with status chips + UTR.
- **`/dashboard/payout-approvals`** (checker/admin): pending queue scoped via
  `scopeUserIdFilter`, approve/reject with remarks, and a detail drawer showing
  the **masked** account (`maskTail`).

## 9. Security checklist

- `requireAuth` + object-level ownership (`scopeUserIdFilter` /
  `assertCanAccessUser`) on every read/write.
- zod validation; rate limit on submit.
- Audit logs: `payout.submitted`, `payout.approved`, `payout.rejected`,
  `payout.success`, `payout.failed`, `payout.reversed`.
- PII (account number, IFSC, UPI VPA) encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM);
  `accountLast4` only for display; raw values never logged.
- Maker-checker separation enforced server-side.
- No secrets reach the client; the payout rail is called only from the worker.
