/**
 * Company TDS Payable account.
 *
 * Every commission payout withholds 2% TDS (Section 194H). The withheld rupees
 * are moved INTO this internal system account so the withholding is a true
 * double-entry movement (Revenue DEBIT gross ↔ payee CREDIT net + TDS-account
 * CREDIT tds) — money is conserved and the account balance equals the
 * outstanding, not-yet-remitted TDS liability the company owes the government.
 *
 * The account is a FINANCE-role system user with a SUSPENDED status (it can
 * never log in) and an unusable random password. FINANCE is excluded from the
 * network-tier liability rollups, so the TDS float never pollutes user totals.
 *
 * Resolved lazily and cached for the process lifetime. Mirrors the Company
 * Suspense account pattern (see wallet/suspense.ts).
