 * Company Suspense / Recovery account.
 *
 * Recovered lien funds (chargeback / fraud) are swept OUT of the offending
 * user and INTO this internal system account, so every recovery is a true
 * double-entry movement (user DEBIT ↔ suspense CREDIT) that recon can verify.
 *
 * The account is a FINANCE-role system user with a SUSPENDED status (it can
 * never log in) and an unusable random password. FINANCE is excluded from the
 * network-tier liability rollups, so the suspense float never pollutes the
 * user-liability totals.
 *
 * Resolved lazily and cached for the process lifetime.
