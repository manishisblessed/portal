All company info (name, CIN, address, phone, email, domain) lives in a single `company` object exported from `src/lib/data.ts` — change it once and it updates everywhere.

## 🎨 Design system

- **Brand blue** (`#185df5`) — primary actions, links
- **Accent orange** (`#f97606`) — secondary CTAs, highlights
- **Ink** scale — neutral text/background
- Two custom fonts via `next/font`: **Inter** (sans) + **Manrope** (display)
- Reusable utility classes: `.container-x`, `.section`, `.eyebrow`, `.heading-xl/lg/md`, `.lead`, `.gradient-text`

## 🔌 Production stack (already wired)

- **Neon Postgres** via Prisma — schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`. Run `npm run db:migrate` then `npm run db:seed`.
- **Cloudinary** for KYC docs / shop photos / agreements (signed direct browser uploads).
- **Partner-agnostic adapters** in `src/lib/partners/` for AePS, DMT, UPI Collect, RazorpayX Payouts, BBPS, Recharges, Travel, PAN, SMS (MSG91), Email (Resend). Each runs in MOCK mode until the corresponding `PARTNER_*_ENABLED` env flag is flipped to `true`.
- **Money-safe orchestrator** in `src/lib/services/transaction.ts` — idempotency, atomic wallet debit/credit, auto-refund on failure, audit logs.
- **Health endpoint** at `GET /api/healthz` reports DB and partner status.

See [`PRODUCTION.md`](./PRODUCTION.md) for the full launch runbook (Neon setup, Cloudinary setup, partner integrations, hosting on Vercel, EAS submit for mobile, compliance checklist).

## 📱 Mobile app

A React Native (Expo) retailer app lives in [`mobile_app/`](./mobile_app). It mirrors the web flows with biometric login, 5-tab navigation and all 16 services. Run with:

```bash
cd mobile_app
npm install
npm start
```

## 🔐 Secrets

Never commit `.env` or `.env.local`. Both are gitignored. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in real values for local development; configure the same keys in your hosting provider's secret manager for production.
